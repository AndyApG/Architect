        A good stage title should be descriptive, but not too long. It should help you to remember
        the purpose of this stage later.

        It might help to use a standard format for the names of your interview stages, such as

        The Information Interface allows you to display text and rich media (including pictures,
        video and audio) to your participants. Use it to help explain interview tasks, or introduce
        concepts or ideas.

      <h3>Name Generator guidance</h3>

        The Name Generator interface is designed to allow your research participants
        to name alters for later analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        After giving your stage a descriptive title, you should determine the type
        of node that you wish to elicit. Either choose from your existing node types,
        or create a new one.
